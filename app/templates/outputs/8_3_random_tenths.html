<!-- > Write a short story about Paul Broca.
In 1865, French anthropologist and physician Pierre Paul Broca (January 20th, 1824 ‚Äì July 9th, 1880) was the first to
describe what is now known as "Broca's area" in his research on aphasia. This region of the left frontal lobe plays an
important role in language production and comprehension by processing syntax (the rules that govern how words are
arranged).
In 1970, Broca was honored with having one of Jupiter‚Äôs moons named after him: "Brocanius". -->
